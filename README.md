### General Information
Visual Question Answering (VQA) is gaining momentum for its ability of bridging Computer Vision and Natural Language Process ing. However, VQA approaches rely on Machine Learning (ML) algo rithms, need to be trained on large annotated datasets for achieving good performances, and, once trained, a ML model is barely portable on a different domain. This calls for agile methodologies for building large annotated datasets from existing resources. The cultural heritage domain represents both a natural application of this task and an exten sive source of data for training and validating VQA models. To this end, by using data and models from ArCo (Architecture of Knowledge), the knowledge graph of the Italian cultural heritage, we generated a large dataset for VQA in Italian and English. 

### Data
The dataset contains 6.49M question-answer pairs covering cultural assets, 43 question templates and 282 verbal forms. The number of pairs per template ranges from 35 to 576K.
Together with the complete dataset, we provide a small sample of question-answer pairs from different question templates and cultural asset types and a grid with the distribution of question-answer pairs over question templates and cultural asset types. 
We also provide statistics on how many times questions from every question template were formulated by the surveyed users and how many time a question template was evoked by a user.
